About Me
I am currently a Large Model Application Algorithm Engineer at Ant Group, working within the Security Department. My work focuses on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance foundational security and developing robust algorithmic solutions for large-scale safety challenges.

Prior to joining Ant Group in 2024, I spent six years at the Huawei Beijing Research Institute, where I was a core member of the Xiaoyi (Celia) Development Department. During my tenure there, I contributed to the development of intelligent voice assistant technologies and system interactions.

I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science (2018) and B.Eng. in Information Engineering (2017) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). My early engineering experience includes a year-long internship at the HSBC Hong Kong Data Center, where I worked on Enterprise Management Systems.
